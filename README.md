# Description
This is a portfolio created with multiple work samples in hopes that a future employer likes what they see.
Included is an about me section with a photo of myself, contact information, and projects I  have worked on.
When a link is clicked he UI scrolls to the corresponding place on the page. The first application is larger than the others'.
Although I have yet to create an application so clicking these will lead to no where. When the page is resized 
it is formatted to fit the page for a variety of sizes.
